# LLM-powered-Chatbot
This project is regarding practising and creating chat bots powered by Large Langauage Models and UI is built on top of streamlit library.

# What Large Language Model is used for the creation of chatbot?
I have used ** Google Gemini ** model for Chat model purpose.

By using Google Gemini we have access to Google AI embeddings, as compared to the open source embedding, opting Google Gemini is the best option because of it capabitlity to convert the texts into embeddings on air and are faster than most of the available embedding in the open source environment.
